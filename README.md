# Hello CircuitPython
### Objective
Make an LED fade in and out on CircuitPython.
### Lesson
We learned to use While True instead of using loops. This was also my first time using the Metro and CircuitPython so I got started learning some of it. I ended up needing a lot of help from google and friends.

# CircuitPython Servo
### Objective
Make a servo move right or left depending on which wire is touched.
### Lesson
I learned how to do this assignment by using Capacitive touch on the metro. It was difficult using a PWM pin. I was not very familiar with coding servos, especially on CircuitPython so that was really helpful.

# CicuitPython LCD
### Objective
Use a button to make a variable go up and down on a LCD Screen.
### Lesson
I Learned how to use the new code to make the LCD work while using a button and a switch. I Learned how useful the backback is for the LCD screen.

# Photo Interrupters
### Objective
Used a Photointerrupter to display the interruptions every four seconds.
### Lesson
I learned how to make something register through a photointerruptor every four seconds which was a struggle. In the end I learned to make it register every time but only show it on the serial monitor every four seconds.

# Distance Sensor
### Objective
We used a HC-SR04 to make the rgb LED change colors according to the distance of an object.
### Lesson
I learned how to change the colors and the code for different rgb colors. I learned that the colors are just like in real life and you can add each of the three basic colors to make almost any color.

# Hello Git
### Objective
We dowloaded the Git Bash app and edited my ReadME.md.
### Lesson
I learned how to use Git Bash and how to edit my readME.md through the 
# Hello GitHub
### Objective
We created a repository to put all of our assignments in.
### Lesson
I learned a new way to edit my GitHub. I also found it very useful when starting to organize my assignments.
# Forks and Clones
### Objective
We forked the CHS Sigma account and made a copy for our own account.
### Lesson
I learned how to get to other peoples repository. I learned how to fork repositories from the class and clone them.
# Classes, Objects, and Modules
### Objective
Made a library for the rgb LED in one tab while we had another one named main.py.
### Lesson
I learned how to make libraries on CircuitPython which is very useful to minimize your code. I also learned how wire RGB LED's.

# Hello vs Code
### Objective
We learned how to print something in the serial monitor of vs code.
### Lesson
I learned how to use vs code when printing code and using it to push and commit something into my GitHub. This made it easier for us to use GitBash
# FancyLED
